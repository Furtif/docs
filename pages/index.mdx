# Welcome to Unown#

ðŸ‘‹ We're a group dedicated to building the next-gen Pokemon Go mapping stack.

## Why did you make this?

We wanted to try something new, and the early results were promising. The current tools in this space have been around for a few years. As such, they are stable, but increasingly difficult to add new features. Unown# allows us to re-think legacy ideas, rebuild from the ground up, and build a better user experience for all involved.

## Core services

- **Dragonite** - Is our backend controller for game specific tasks. It tells workers what to scan and when to do it.
- **Dragonite-Admin** - This web frontend is your primary method for interacting with the Unown# stack.
- **Golbat** - Is our data processor. Its primary purpose is to listen for events, format them into something useful for external tools, store them in a database, and send webhooks to external services.
- **Rotom** - Is our device controller that receives communications from workers (devices) and distributes them to Dragonite.

## Features

Each service is incredibly customizable and highly optimized. Many core services are written in Go, providing a great developer experience, excellent concurrency, great memory management, fast HTTP handling, and more. Additionally, our design uses micro-services which allows for significant flexibility. There are no issues if you need to split services between multiple servers.

Some of highlighted features:

- Advanced Ditto detection
- Gym parsing
- In Memory Pokemon Cache
- Invasions line-up parsing
- IV, shiny, hundo, & nundo statistics
- Pokemon parsing
- Pokestop parsing
- PVP calculation
- Quest parsing
- Routes parsing
- Webhook processing
