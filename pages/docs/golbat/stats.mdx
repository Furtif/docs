# Statistics

Golbat comes with basic database statistics built in. These tables are named with the `_stats` suffix. With these tables you can use raw SQL queries or hook into a third party visualization tool to visualize the data that Golbat is parsing.

[Blissey](/docs/other/blissey) and our [Prometheus](/docs/other/prometheus) integration can be used to get started on visualizing the data.
