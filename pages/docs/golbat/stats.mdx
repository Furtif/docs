# Statistics

Golbat comes with basic database statistics built in. These tables are named with the `_stats` suffix. From here are are able to use raw SQL queries or hook into a third party visualization tool.

There is also [Blissey](/docs/blissey) and our [Prometheus](https://github.com/UnownHash/Golbat/pull/100) integration if want to help build with the community.
